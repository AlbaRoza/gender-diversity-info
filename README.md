## About the maintainer

Building empathy for every single being and situation in our world is a lifelong mission for me. Recently, I began self-studying feminist theory. Being a gender and racial minority in my industry, an activist for reproductive and LGBT rights, and volunteer in outreach programs, I did not realise that I'm a feminist until I embarked on my quest to learn more about diversity. 

I am a software developer, yoga teacher, photographer, and artist.
